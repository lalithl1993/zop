Hey Everyone,

	I would like to take a movement to thank everyone for being a part of my Accenture journey.
Every journey has to end. Today, time has come to end my journey as well.
It was great experience working in Accenture as a part of BIWS Travelers team. I started as a Novice and learnt a lot of stuff, be it professional or personal.
It may be my last day in organization it does not mean end of our personal journey. I am always available and can contact me anytime. 
Please find my contact details below
